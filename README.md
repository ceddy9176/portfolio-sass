## Description

This site uses sass/scss to make css components of my website modular, and I used grid and flex to position my projects. I also used media queries to make my webpage responsive for tablet and phone. I also had a transition that changed a sidebar to a nav-bar using bootstrap, and I used css animations to make a pre-loader before my page loads and if if it wont load within 30 seconds it will automatically load.
