## Specs
| Term  | Description | Implementation |
| ---------- | ----------- | -------------- |
|float | The float property specifies whether or not a box, like an element, should float. | I used float for many elements to pull them to one side of the page |
|display: block | The display: block property  displays an element as a block element like a (p) tag | I used this on elements to add margin to the box to move them around the page. |
|display: inline-block | The display: inline property is the default value and displays an element as an inline element like a span tag | i used this as inline blocks to keep elements inline with each other. |
| span | The (span) tag is used to group inline-elements in a document, it provides no visual change by itself, and the tag provides a way to add a hook to a part of a text or a part of a document. | I used this tag to insert text next to my divs |
|centered content: text Align| The (center) tag is used to center-align text. | I used this to center text within the div |
|pseudo-element |  CSS pseudo-element is used to style specified parts of an element. | I used the :first-letter element to change the first letter to an uppercase letter. |
|pseudo-class | A pseudo-class is used to define a special state of an element. | I used the :hover class to change the color of buttons when you hover over them. |
|positional selector | In CSS, selectors are patterns used to select the element(s) you want to style. | I would give an element an id or class and add a property like float, top, or margin to position it on the page were I wanted to.
|selector combinator |  A CSS selector can contain more than one simple selector. Between the simple selectors, we can include a combinator such as descendant selector (space) child selector (>) adjacent sibling selector (+) and a general sibling selector (~) | I used a coma to select multiple divs to style multiple divs at once to keep the code dry. |
