    <h1>This my dog, Jagger <em>(It's actually a picture of another dog that looks like him)</em></h1>
    <h2>Jagger is 6 years old and 120 pounds</h2>
    <h3>Jagger is kind of a brat and will whimper until he gets what he wants</h3>
    <h3>Here are some things he likes to do:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Chase his tail</li>
        <li>Run into walls</li>
          <p>He often sprints into them</p>
        <li>Eat out of the trash</li>
        <li>Bark at neighbors</li>
      </ul>
